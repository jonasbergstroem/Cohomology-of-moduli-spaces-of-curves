# Cohomology-of-moduli-spaces-of-curves

A compilation of results about the cohomology of moduli spaces of smooth and stable curves based on research from several different sources. 

## Details

All Euler characteristics will have values in the Grothendieck group of ell-adic absolute Galois representations. The S_n-equivariant Euler characteristics also keep track of the action of the symmetric group S_n, whose irreducible representations will be indexed in the usual fashion by Schur functions s[mu] with mu a partition of $n$. 

We denote the cyclotomic character of Deligne weight 2 by "L" and by S[k] the Galois representation (of dimension 2*dim S_k) corresponding to the space S_k of elliptic cusp forms of weight k and level 1. 

Note that (by purity of a smooth and proper DM-stack), a Galois representation appearing in the Euler characteristic of any moduli space of stable curves of Deligne weight i will appear in (the semi-simplification of) its ith cohomology group.
